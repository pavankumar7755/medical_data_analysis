# medical_data_analysis
To analyze patterns from patient appointment data and understand factors that may be associated with patients not showing up for their scheduled medical appointments




Understand Patient Behavior Around Missed Medical Appointments
By analyzing the dataset, we aim to:
1.	Identify patterns or factors that may contribute to patients missing their medical appointments (e.g., age, gender, chronic illness, reminders, location).
2.	Evaluate the effectiveness of interventions, like SMS reminders, in reducing no-shows.
3.	Provide actionable insights for healthcare providers to:
o	Improve appointment attendance.
o	Reduce wasted time and resources.
o	Improve patient care and clinic efficiency.

üßæ Dataset Description
The dataset includes information about medical appointments in Brazil and whether patients showed up or not. Each row represents a patient appointment with the following fields:
‚Ä¢	PatientId: Unique identifier for a patient.
‚Ä¢	AppointmentID: Unique identifier for the appointment.
‚Ä¢	Gender: Patient‚Äôs gender.
‚Ä¢	ScheduledDay: Timestamp when the appointment was scheduled.
‚Ä¢	AppointmentDay: The day the appointment was supposed to take place.
‚Ä¢	Age: Age of the patient.
‚Ä¢	Neighbourhood: Location of the patient.
‚Ä¢	Scholarship: Whether the patient is enrolled in a social welfare program.
‚Ä¢	Hipertension / Diabetes / Alcoholism / Handicaps: Medical conditions flagged as binary (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
‚Ä¢	SMS_received: Whether an SMS reminder was sent.
‚Ä¢	No-show: Indicates if the patient missed the appointment ("Yes") or not ("No").

üîç Data Exploration & Key Observations
1. No-show Rate
‚Ä¢	From the sample, 3 out of 18 patients did not show up for their appointments.
‚Ä¢	No-show Rate = (3 / 18) * 100 ‚âà 16.7%
2. Gender Distribution
‚Ä¢	Female patients: 14
‚Ä¢	Male patients: 4
‚Ä¢	Among the no-shows, all 3 are female.
‚Ä¢	Observation: Females are more frequent in the dataset, but further investigation is needed to assess if they are more likely to miss appointments.
3. Age Factor
‚Ä¢	Ages range from 8 to 76.
‚Ä¢	No-shows were observed in the age groups: 23, 29, 40.
‚Ä¢	No clear trend with age from this small sample, but mid-aged adults may be more likely to miss appointments.
4. Chronic Conditions
‚Ä¢	Out of the 3 no-shows:
o	1 had a handicap
o	None had hypertension or diabetes
o	All 3 had no alcoholism
‚Ä¢	Observation: Chronic conditions were not clearly linked to no-shows in this subset.
5. SMS Reminders
‚Ä¢	2 out of 3 no-shows received SMS reminders, while 1 did not.
‚Ä¢	This suggests SMS reminders alone may not guarantee attendance.
6. Neighbourhood Analysis
‚Ä¢	The Nova Palestine neighborhood has the highest number of appointments (7).
‚Ä¢	Among the no-shows:
o	1 was from Nova Palestine
o	1 from Goiabeiras
o	1 from Conquista
‚Ä¢	Observation: No-shows are spread across different neighborhoods, so locality might not be a strong factor.

‚úÖ Recommendations
1.	Investigate why mid-aged female patients tend to miss appointments‚Äîit could be work/life balance or transport-related.
2.	Improve communication beyond SMS, approach for whatsapp, such as phone calls or app-based reminders.
3.	Further analyze full 110K+ records for statistical validation of these trends.
4.	Consider adding cancellation options to distinguish between intentional no-shows and emergencies.
